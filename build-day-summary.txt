--- GREEN URBAN GROW - DAY SUMMARY ---

1. Code Written Today:

# Workflows:
.github/workflows/build.yml
- Initially attempted Gradle build, artifact upload.
- Errors: ./gradlew not found (no root, no Gradle), repeated failure.

.github/workflows/upload-apk.yml
- Correct workflow format for uploading prebuilt APK.
- No Gradle involved, works with manual prebuilt APK.

# AndroidManifest.xml fixes:
- Tried to remove package attribute and add android:exported via perl one-liner:
  perl -0777 -pe 's/\s*package="[^"]*"//s; s{(<activity\b(?:(?!android:exported)[\s\S])*?android:name="[^"]*MainActivity"(?:(?!android:exported)[\s\S])*?)>}{$1 android:exported="true">}smi' -i AndroidManifest.xml
- Failed due to wrong path (green-urban-grow-clean vs green-urban-grow).

# Other commands:
- mkdir for workflow folders.
- cp prebuilt APK to android/app/build/outputs/apk/release.
- git add, commit, push commands.
- find ~/ -type f -name "app-release.apk" used to locate APK.

2. Errors Encountered:
- Gradle attempts failed (./gradlew not found, SDK issues).
- xmllint not installed in Termux CI environment.
- Wrong paths (green-urban-grow vs green-urban-grow-clean).
- Multiple syntax issues when combining EOF and && in one-liners.
- Workflow dispatch errors when missing workflow_dispatch trigger.

3. What Worked:
- Uploading prebuilt APK using GitHub Actions.
- Proper workflow YAML format without Gradle.
- Creating directories and copying APK using single one-liner.

4. Lessons Learned:
- Gradle cannot be used on CI without root/setup.
- One-liner YAML creation must separate EOF block from git commands.
- Always check paths; clean vs regular repo can break commands.
- Prebuilt APK approach is the only reliable method for CI in Termux environment.

5. Notes for Next AI Programmer:
- Skip Gradle completely for CI.
- Focus on copying prebuilt APK to correct folder.
- Ensure workflow_dispatch trigger exists if manual run is needed.
- Verify all paths are accurate relative to the repo.
- Single-line commands are safest for Termux workflow automation.
